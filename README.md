The model was trained in collaboration with WikiAves, which is a world renowned website for bird cataloging. There, thousands of new bird audios and pictures are uploaded daily by users, and a considerable amount of human resources is spent to correct misclassified information. To aid users with the selection of the correct bird species in the uploaded photos and audios, this model was designed by me using state of the art practices, and achieves 90.8% top-1 and 95.3% top-5 accuracy across all 1890 species, with sex and age division that totals to 4188 classes!
